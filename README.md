# "Solving problems with Deep Learning: an in-depth example using PyTorch and its ecosystem" tutorial/lab

This beginner-level lab was originally presented as a live 3-hour session at Microsoft-internal "Machine Learning, AI, and 
Data Science" conference (MLADS) in November 2019.

For MLADS Spring 2020, the lab was updated and converted into a self-paced format. You don't have to be a 
Microsoft employee to do the lab, it's available to everyone.

To start, download the [spring2020mlads.pptx](./spring2020mlads.pptx) presentation (PowerPoint, but works OK with LibreOffice) 
and follow the slides.
